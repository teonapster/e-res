# e-res
E-Resort  project

This project developed in order to test some front-end validation tools such as karma & protractor. Moreover it would be a good chance for us to test some java tools in the server-side (back-end) code. To be more specific, this rep includes:

#### Frontend
######Dev Tools:
* AngularJs

######Package managers:
* npm
* bower
 

######Task runner:
* grunt


#### Backend
*  JAX-RS: Java API for RESTful Web Services
*  JPA: Java Persistence Api
*  Derby
  

###Install front-end libraries
We take it for granted that you already have installed **npm** and **bower** package managers. We assume also that you have a basic knowledge of command line syntax. In order to avoid manual installation for every package, two list files have been made: 
* bower.js and
* package.json

These files contain the total packages that are needed to run 'n test e-res. Some packages are included for future releases.

Access the following path:
<code> e-res/src/main/webapp </code>
and run in command line (maybe super user rights are needed)
* <code> npm install </code> (bower.js will be used automatically)
* <code> bower install </code> (package.json will be used automatically)
